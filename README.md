Enyo Todo
=========

A simple todo application to show of Enyo.

In the source directory are a series of files that correspond to the steps we will be taking throughout the development of the app.

To minify the app and prepare it for deployment, use the deploy.sh/deploy.bat script as follows:

tools/deploy.sh or tools\deploy.bat

If you will be uploading to PhoneGap Build, be sure to copy the config.xml file into the deploy directory before zipping and uploading.

This project is based on Enyo's Bootplate.

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/wiki/Bootplate) for how to get started.
